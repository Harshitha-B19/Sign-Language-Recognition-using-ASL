The challenge at hand is to develop a robust Sign Language Recognition (SLR) system for American Sign Language (ASL) that accurately recognizes and interprets ASL gestures, enabling real-time translation. This system aims to address the communication barriers faced by ASL users in education, employment, and daily interactions, thereby isolating speech-impaired individuals from mainstream society. The goal is to leverage technology to empower ASL users and create a more equitable and inclusive society. Furthermore, this system should integrate with various computer applications, enhancing accessibility and inclusivity, and ultimately bridging the gap between the speech-impaired and the broader community.
